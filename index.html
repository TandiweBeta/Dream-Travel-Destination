     <h3>About Seychelles</h3>
     <p>
      Seychelles lies northeast of Madagascar, an archipelago of 115 islands with roughly 98,000 citizens. Seychelles is a melting pot of many cultures which have commingled and coexisted since the first settlement of the islands in 1770. The three main inhabited islands are Mah√©, Praslin and La Digue and the official languages are English, French and Seychellois Creole.A diverse history contributes greatly to the culture in Seychelles. A myriad of different ethnicities - African, European, Arab and Indian people - live in a harmonious country where diversity is an integral part of the landscape. Even if Catholicism is the most common religion in Seychelles, Hinduism and Islam contribute to the religious environment. Culture in Seychelles transports you to a world with both Creole and Western influences. This heritage is found through a particularly diverse architecture. Indeed, you can admire the majestic colonial mansions that transport you to another era.

             <h4>Grilled Fish</h4>
              <p>
               
           At the heart of any menu in Seychelles, is the nation‚Äôs fantastic offerings of fish. Caught fresh daily and nearly always cooked on the grill, to provide a true ocean-to-plate experience that is like none other in the world. Local specialities include red snapper, jobfish, jackfish, sailfish or parrotfish and each are simply irresistible when served with the region‚Äôs mouthwatering marinade of lemon juice, ginger, garlic and chilli. Keep an eye out for the local fisherman and their countless colourful boats that can be seen fishing for your dinner in the heart of the Indian Ocean.

          <h4>  Les Roussettes</h4>
          <p>
          
        Literally translating as the flying bats in French, les roussettes is just that: flying fruit bats that are most commonly served in a lip-searing curry (or occasionally grilled). But don‚Äôt be deterred by this unfamiliar sounding dish, which has emerged as a longstanding local delicacy and is now a favourite among fearless foodies in Seychelles. Should you be in search of the dish during your stay, les roussettes is assured to be unlike anything you have ever eaten - but you‚Äôll simply have to try it for yourself to find out!

        <h4>  Satini</h4>
          <p>
         Another dish that is completely unique to Seychelles, satini is essentially a salad. But unlike most other salads in the world, this one is made using a medley of seafood which is then mashed and mixed with a variety of fruits and spices. Most commonly served with lime, onions, blimbi (local fruit), papaya, apple, chilli and lots of turmeric - which gives satini its yellow appearance. Such is the popularity of this local delicacy, you‚Äôll find it in almost every creole restaurant as an accompaniment to your main course.
